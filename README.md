# Learn Binary Search the Hard Way!

Sure, you think you know binary search...

Just use a sorted array, make a left and right pointer, and move them inwards. Easy right?

Wrong!

I made this tool because I always forget how to adjust my binary search edge cases for specific scenarios:

- How do you use binary search to get the highest number less than target?
- How do you use binary search to find the first instance of target in the array?
- How do you use binary search to find the smallest value greater than the target when the target is not present in the array?

I always mess these up, use this tool to help you not mess them up too!
